On 31-JUL-1999 patient was addmited in hospital with heart failure and was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. There, he received multiple treatments including anticoagulation drugs, antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs. During this period of time he presented bronchopneumonia bilateral, pleural effusion hypertension, pulmonary, cor pulmonary, gastrointestinal disorders, depression, hyponatremia and invasive candida (positive hemoculture and urinary culture for candida albicans on 20-AUG-1999). On 21-AUG-1999 the patient was placed on therapy with mk-991 or control, inj. He had good tolerance by 3  days. In day 4 before the drug application he presented sudden hypotension discomfort, weakness and venipuction area became very red. At 10 am a ECG was taken. It did not show any significant changes. The therapy with MK-991 or control was discontinued anyway. At 1:45 pm patient presented respiratory difficulties, rales, wheezing and ventricular fibrillation. Resucitation maneuver were doing during40 minutes but patient died. Concomitant therapy included furosemide, isophane insulin suspension, trimetazidine dihydrochloride, warfarin sodium, losartan potasium (MSD), (beta)-methyldigoxin, isosorbide dinitrate, bendroflumethiazide and tramadol hydrochloride. The cause of death was ventricular fibrillation and heart failure,ischemic.

ormation has been received concerning a 39-year-old female with lupus erythematodes and light sensitivity who, on 17-Nov-91, was placed on therapy with imipenem for the treatment of meningococcal sepsis. Concomitant therapy included insulin, prednisone, fentanyl, midazolam, amikacin p.o., acetyl cystein and nystatin. On 15-Nov-91 therapy with heparin sodium s.c. for the prophylaxis of thrombosis, therapy with dopamin i.v. for the treatment of hypertension and therapy with amphotericin i.v. for the treatment of mycosis was initiated. On 17-Nov-91 she was placed on therapy with imipenem i.v. and vancomycin i.v. both for treatment of sepsis. On 18-Nov-91 she was placed on therapy with flucyt osin p.o. for treatment of mycosis. On 20-Nov-91 the patient was set on therapy with tramadol i.v. against pain, vitamine mixture i.v. (A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D3, E), omeprazol i.v. (NOD) for the prophylaxis of stress ulcera and for one day she was set on therapy with metamizol i.v. against pain. On 21-Nov-91 therapy with dopamin, tramadol and midazolam was discontinued and therapy with prednisone i.v. and amphotericin B p.o. for the treatment of mycosis was started and only for one day she was set on therapy with magnesium p.o.. On the 22-Nov-91 the patient was transfered to the intensive care unit. On 23-Nov-91 therapy with omeprazol and imipenem was discontinued. On 24-Nov-91 therapy with  flucytosin was discontinued and therapy with metoprolol tartrate p.o. was initiated. On 25-Nov-91 therapy with amphotericin was discontinued. On 26-Nov-91 therapy with trimetoprim i.v. for the treatment of meningococcal encephalitis was initiated. On 27-Nov-91 therapy with vitamin mixture was discontinued and therapy with azathioprin p.o. for thetreatment of lupus erythematodes was initiated. On 28-Nov-91 the patient experienced a Stevens-Johnson syndrom which worsened to a toxic epidermal necrolysis. Therapy with azathioprin was discontinued the same day. The reporting physician felt that the toxic epidermal necrolysis was possibly related to imipenem or following concomitant therapy: met oprolol tartrate, azathioprine, midazolam, amphotericin, omeprazol, dopamin, heparin sodium, prednisone, vancomycin, amphotericin B, amikacin, flucytosine, vitamin mixture, tramadol HCl); probably related to trimetoprim or to metamizol and probably not related to nystatin, acetyl cystein, amikacin, fentanyl or prednisone.

During the induction she received fentanyl 150 microg and propofol 100 mg with good effect. Thereafter Esmeron was given 30 mg intravenously and she was intubated, but she was difficult to ventilate. Pulmonary auscultation revealed rhonchi and rales. An injection with theophyllamine was given but nothing changed. A major redness all over the body appeared, at the same time the blood pressure fell to levels that were not measurable. Treatment with ephedrin, Solu-Crotef (hydrocortisone) and adrenaline was started. The patient recovered slowly with a palpable pulse and blood pressure of 170 mmHg, which later fell to 60 mmHg.
